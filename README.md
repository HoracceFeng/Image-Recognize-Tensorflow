Image Recognition Platform with Baseline Model

This project is for image recognition task using tensorflow, baseline model will be supported with ImageNet pretrained model.
Now this project only support SEnet series baseline model training.
ReadMe file will be supported later.

To Do:
[x] SEnet support 
[x] multiple gpu support
[x] Data Generator Module Optimization
[x] VGG
[ ] softmax_cross_entropy_with_logit update, disclose the logit, softmax and the CE loss calculation

[ ] ResNet, ResNext
[ ] DenseNet
[ ] Condense
[ ] ReadMe file
[ ] voc pretrain & eval
[ ] modelfile amelirate (get smaller)
